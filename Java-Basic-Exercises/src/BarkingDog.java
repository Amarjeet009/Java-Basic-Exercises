/**************************************************CODE EXERCISE 3: BARKING DOG**********************************************************************
 Description Exercise:

 We have a dog that likes to bark. We need to wake up if the dog is barking at night!

 - Write a method shouldWakeUp that has 2 parameters.
 - 1st parameter should be of type boolean and be named barking, it represents if our dog is currently parking.
 - 2nd parameter represents the hour of the day and is of type int with the name hourOfDay and has a valid range of 0 - 23.
 - We have to wake up if the dog is barking before 8 or after 22 hours s in that case return value
 - In all other case return false.
 - If the hourOfDay parameter is less than 0 or greater than 23 return false.

 TIP/NOTES:
 - Use the if-else statement with multiple conditions.
 - The shouldWakeUp method needs to be defined as public static
 - In this code solution, no main method used.
