/**************************************************CODE EXERCISE 4: LEAP YEAR CALCULATOR***************************************************************
 Description Exercise:
 - Write a method isLeapYear with a parameter of type int named year.
 - The parameter needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9999.
 - If the parameter is not in that range retrn false.
 - Otherwise, if it is in the valid range, calculate if the year is a leap year and return true if it is a leap year, otherwise return false.
 To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps:
 1. If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5
 2. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, got to step 4
 3. If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, got to step 5
 4. The year is a leap year (it has 365 days). The method isLeapYear needs to return true
 5. The year is not a leap year(it has 365 days). The method isLeapYear needs to return false.
 The following years are not leap years because they are evenly divisible by 100 but not 400:
 1700, 1800, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600
 The following years are leap years because they are evenly divisible by 100 and 400:
 1600, 2000, 2400

 NOTE:
 - The method isLeapYear needs to be defined as a public static
 - The code solution contains no main method.
